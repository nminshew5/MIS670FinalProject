# An Analysis of News Head Lines

News headlines are very important and can make a huge impact on the success of the article and ultimately the outlet. A lot of readers skim headlines to either gather the information they want or find articles they would like to read. What can we find if we explore headlines from the top news outlets in the United States? 

## Business Questions
* How are events portrayed/framed by different news sources?
* Do news headlines tend to be positive or negative? Why?
* What are the most popular topics across all top news outlets in the US?
* How do outlets use headlines to attract certain types of readers? (Liberal/Conservative)
* Can word pairs (bigrams) create a network of headlines?
* Can we find clusters for categories, outlets, political biases, etc...?
